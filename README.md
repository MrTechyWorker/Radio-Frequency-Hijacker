About
Frequencies !!! One of the major mode of specific data transfer. Capturing them and cloning them paves way to many possibilities.

Nowadays machines use much higher or lower frequency which cannot be captured easily. This prototype can be used to find vulnerable key frequencies and can easily find them.

Requirements
Raspberry Pi 0/2/3/3b/3b+/4
Power source
Monitor, if ssh is not enabled
RF receiver or transmitter module
Raspberry Pi setup
Download, install and boot the Raspberrian OS to your Pi
Open terminal and run the following commands:
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install rpi-rf
All the installations and setup are complete
Connections
Connect VCC and GND pins to respective pins
Connect DAT pin of receiver to GPIO 27 and transmitter pin to GPIO 22
Receiving
Run the command:

rpi-rf_receive

This will display all the sourrouding RFs


In my case, the highlighted one is what I need.

Transmitting
Run the command:

rpi-rf_send -g "GPIO" -p "pulsestrength" -t "protocol" "CODE"

Make sure you replace the quoted arguments as per your need. In my case the code will be... rpi-rf_send -g 17 -p 1024 -t 4 4096.

You can also repeat the frequency with a "-r" argument extra with the number of times u need.
